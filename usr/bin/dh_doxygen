=head1 NAME

dh_doxygen - helps with packaging doxygen-generated documentation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

dh_doxygen [S<I<debhelper options>>] [B<-X>I<item>] [I<directory>...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dh_doxygen> is a debhelper program that prepares doxygen-generated
documentation for inclusion in a Debian package. More specifically:

=over 4

=item *

It removes F<*.md5> and F<*.map> files. These are created by doxygen to speed
up incremental runs.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item I<directory>

By default, B<dh_doxygen> scans your package looking for directories looking
like they contain doxygen-generated documentation. However, if you explicitly
provide one or more directories, only they will be processed.

=item B<-X>I<item>, B<--exclude=>I<item>

Exclude files that contain I<item> anywhere in their filename from
being symlinked, removed or checked for existence.

=back

=head1 BUGS

Probably.
